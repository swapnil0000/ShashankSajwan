       <Box sx={{display:'inline',color:'#00022e',fontSize:'25px',fontWeight:'500'}}>UPSC CSE</Box>, according to me is not an ordinary exam. It tests your limits, not only mental strength but also physical strength. It tests your overall personality. 
       For me an aspirantâ€™s overall development is a must in order to achieve success in this exam. 
       During my long UPSC journey <Box sx={{display:'inline',color:'#00022e',fontSize:'20px',fontWeight:'500'}}>I had many ups and downs</Box>. I learned different aspects of this exam and gained experience and knowledge with which I can help you clear this exam based on my experience and experiments. 
       I believe the most important thing to clear this exam is right direction, clear approach and a good plan. Due to lack of knowledge, 
       beginners do make mistakes which can really harm their preparation and that is where my <Box sx={{display:'inline',color:'#00022e',fontSize:'25px',fontWeight:'500'}}>  Guidance and Mentorship</Box>  will come handy.
       From basic doubt to an advanced problem I will be guiding and showing the right direction and will help the aspirants in every aspect during their this beautiful journey of civil services preparation.
